## Answer
```python
from graphics import Canvas

CANVAS_WIDTH = 400
CANVAS_HEIGHT = 300
THIS_BIG = 144
CENTER_X = 160
CENTER_Y = 160

def main():
	canvas = Canvas(CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT)

    # Makes our rectangle centered at (CENTER_X, CENTER_Y)!
    # Since we draw starting at the left-most x and top-most y,
    # we need to take however big our square is (THIS_BIG)
    # and put half of it to the left and above the center, and the other
    # half to the right and below the center.
	canvas.create_rectangle(
		CENTER_X - THIS_BIG / 2,  # Put half of the square to the left of CENTER_X
		CENTER_Y - THIS_BIG / 2,  # Put half of the square above CENTER_Y
		CENTER_X + THIS_BIG / 2,  # Put half of the square to the right of CENTER_X
		CENTER_Y + THIS_BIG / 2   # Put half of the square below CENTER_Y
	)


# There is no need to edit code beyond this point
