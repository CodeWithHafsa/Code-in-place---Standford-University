## Double
Fill out the double(num) function to return the result of multiplying num by 2. We've written a main() function for you which asks the user for a number, calls your code for double(num) , and prints the result.

Here's a sample run of the program (user input in bold italics):

```
Enter a number: 2 
Double that is 4
```

### Given Code
```python
"""
This is a worked example. This code is starter code; you should edit and run it to 
solve the problem. You can click the blue show solution button on the left to see 
the answer if you get too stuck or want to check your work!

def double(num):
    pass  # Delete this line and write your code here! :)

# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    num_times_2 = double(num)
    print("Double that is", num_times_2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Answer
```python
def double(num):
    return num * 2

# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    num_times_2 = double(num)
    print("Double that is", num_times_2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
