## Get name
Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Karel (the autograder expects the returned name to be Karel):

```
Howdy Karel ðŸ¤ ! 
```

### Given Code

def get_name():
    pass  # Delete this line and write your code here! :)

# There is no need to edit code beyond this point

def main():
    name = get_name() # get_name() will return a string which we store to the 'name' variable here
    print("Howdy", name, "! ðŸ¤ ")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
