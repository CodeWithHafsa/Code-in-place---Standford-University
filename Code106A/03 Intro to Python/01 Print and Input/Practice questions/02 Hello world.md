## Practice Question # 02
The "Hello, World!" program is a simple introductory program used to demonstrate the basic syntax and functionality of a programming language. In Python, the "Hello, World!" program is typically just one line of code that prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. 

When you run this code, Python will execute the print() function, which takes the string "Hello, World!" as an argument and outputs it to the console. This program is often the first program that beginner programmers write when learning a new language and is a crucial step towards understanding how to write more complex programs. It allows beginners to become familiar with basic syntax and the process of executing code.
