# Nonetypes
## Quest
We have introduced you to four variable types: ints, floats, booleans, and strings. In this section, we are going to take a very brief look at another special variable type called **None**. 

**None** is the keyword that Python uses to indicate when a variable has **no value**.

```python
x = None
```

Why would we want a variable to have no value? Well, sometimes when writing a program, we donâ€™t know what we want the value of a variable to be at the time when the variable is created. The **None** value can serve as a sort of placeholder for when we need to create a variable before we know what value it needs to have. 

## Functions Can Also Give the Value None
The example above is not the only way to get a variable to equal **None**. If you recall from the **User Input section**, we have seen how variables can be set to equal the result of a function call. Well, what happens if the function that we call does not return anything? Do we just get an error? 

**Answer**
The answer is no. It is perfectly fine to set a variable equal to the result of a function that returns void. The result is that the variable will store the value **None**: 

```python
$ Python
>>> x = print("this function returns nothing")
this function returns nothing
>>> x
None
```

## Checking for None
`None` is a cool concept to have, but it can cause errors in our code if we are not expecting it. \
For example, imagine that we have a program that uses a function called `mystery_int()`. `mystery_int()` returns an integer some of the time and **None** otherwise. If mystery_int() returns an int, then we want to print the square of it. Donâ€™t worry too much about the actual code for `mystery_int()`. 

Look at the code below to see how this might work:  
```python
import random

def mystery_int():
	"""
	return 2 or None with equal probability (0.5)
	you can mostly ignore this code
	"""
	if random.random() > 0.5:
		return 2

def main():
   """
   set x equal to mystery_int
   print the square of x
   """
 
   x = mystery_int()
   print(x)
   print(x * x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```
=> Run >_ Show

f you run the above code, there's about a 50% chance that it worked and a 50% chance that you got an error. So, if you got an error ðŸ›‘ what happened?! 

**Answer**
Well, `mystery_int()` gave us **None** instead of an integer. Because NoneType is not a number, we cannot use the * operator on it. The result is an error. So, how do we fix this? 

We can use if statements! NoneType is a comparable object which means that we can use the `==`Â  and `!= comparison operators` on it. If you check to see if any actual value == `None`, you will get `False`. Letâ€™s update our code.

```python
import random

def mystery_int():
	"""
	return 2 or None with equal
	probability (0.5)
	"""
	if random.random() > 0.5:
		return 2


def main():
   """
   set x equal to mystery_int
   check if x is an integer
   if so, print the square of x
   """
 
   x = mystery_int()
   print(x)

   if x != None: 
      print(x * x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```
=> Run >_ Show

Now when `mystery_int()` gives us a value of **None**, we can still have a working program.
