# Scope of Function
In programming, the "scope of a function" refers to the region of a computer program where a variable is defined and can be accessed. Variables declared inside a function are typically only accessible within that function, while variables declared outside of any function (in the global scope) can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

## Scope and Functions:

### Function-Local Scope:
When you define a variable inside a function, it's said to be within that function's scope. This means the variable is only visible and accessible to the code within that function.

### Global Scope:
Variables declared outside of any function are said to be in the global scope. These variables can be accessed by any function within the same program.

### Scope Hierarchy:
Functions can be nested within other functions, creating a hierarchy of scopes. A nested function can access variables in its own scope, as well as the scopes of any functions it's nested within, all the way up to the global scope. 

### Example (using C++ as an illustration, but the concept applies to many languages):

```python
# Global variable
global_var = 10  # Defined in the global scope

def my_function():
    function_var = 20  # Defined in my_function's scope
    print(f"Inside my_function: global_var = {global_var}, function_var = {function_var}")

def main():
    my_function()
    print(f"Inside main: global_var = {global_var}")
    # print(function_var)  # This would cause an error because function_var is not accessible here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In this example: 
* `global_var` is accessible from anywhere in the script.
* `function_var` is only accessible inside `my_function`.

## Why is scope important?
### Encapsulation:
Scope helps to keep variables organized and prevents accidental modification of variables from outside the intended area of code.

### Code Clarity:
It makes code easier to understand and maintain by limiting the visibility of variables.

### Avoiding Conflicts:
Scope prevents naming conflicts. If you have a variable named x inside one function and another variable named x in a different function, they won't interfere with each other because they have different scopes.
