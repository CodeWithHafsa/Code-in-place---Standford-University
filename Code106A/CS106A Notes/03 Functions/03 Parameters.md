# Parameters
In programming, a "function" is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task. Parameters are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition, which act as placeholders for values that will be passed into the function when it's called. Arguments, on the other hand, are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called. 

## Key Points:
### Parameters:
Defined within the function's parentheses in the function definition. They are like named slots where the function expects to receive input values. 

### Arguments:
The values that are passed to the function when it is called. These values fill the parameter slots. 

### Scope:
Parameters are local to the function, meaning they are only accessible within the function's body. 

## Example:
```python
    def greet(name, greeting):  # 'name' and 'greeting' are parameters
        print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

    greet("Alice", "Hello")  # "Alice" and "Hello" are arguments
```
